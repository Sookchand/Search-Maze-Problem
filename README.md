# Search 8 Maze Problem
This is a solution to a maze problem using various search algorithms. The problem is represented as a 2D grid, with the goal being to find a path from the start point (represented by an 'O') to the goal point (represented by an 'X'). The search algorithms used are A*, Greedy Best-First, Breadth-First, Depth-First, and Uniform-Cost.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used for this solution is Python, with the search algorithms implemented using the AIMA library.
## Documentation
- The documentation for the Python language can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/.

- The documentation for the AIMA library can be found at https://aimacode.github.io/aima-python/.
## Lessons Learned
- The lessons learned from this solution are the importance of heuristics in search algorithms, and the power of the A* search algorithm.
- The heuristic used in this solution was the number of misplaced tiles, which helped the algorithm find the optimal solution.
-  The A* search algorithm was able to find the optimal solution in a relatively short amount of time.
